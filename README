Database persistence with spring security
=========================================
Load default values like usernames, passwords, and roles dynamically from an H2 database.
- Create SQL Scripts for Initial Data
- Configure Spring Boot to Run SQL Scripts on Startup
- Ensure passwords are encrypted before storing them in the database.
    - For this, create an endpoint that encrypts the input password and returns the encrypted value.

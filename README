Handling exceptions in  Spring Boot application
===============================================
1) Custom Exception Classes: Define custom exceptions for specific error conditions.

2) Global Exception Handler: Use @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler to handle exceptions globally.

3) Controller: Throw exceptions as needed, and let the global exception handler manage them.

4) Custom Error Responses: Customize error responses to provide meaningful feedback to clients.

Testing using postman
=====================
The below should be accessible without any authentication:
http://localhost:8080/api/employees/all
http://localhost:8080/api/employees/create
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John",
    "password": "Doe1"
}

Any other endpoint will need to go through authentication:
http://localhost:8080/api/employees/admin
admin/adminpass
http://localhost:8080/api/user
user/userpass

Go to the Authorization tab in postman
Select Basic Auth from the dropdown.
Enter the username (admin) and password (adminpass).
Send the request.
You should receive a response if the credentials are correct.
